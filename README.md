WATER_ANALYSIS
==============
Assortment of codes to look at the properties of water. Some codes take xyz files, and other take XDATCAR files. 
I have placed converter scripts for convert from xyz to xdatcar or vice versa. IMPORTANT: for the xdatcar files be 
to only have data in them; get rid of the header or any other text.
